# Absence project
The project aims to develop a straightforward, effective, and rapid method for recording absences in schools and universities.
# The method of work
The main code which is responsible for taking absence is a C++ code wich comparing mac addresses on the network with mac addresses saved on a CSV using data out of WNetWatcher. 
# User-friendly interface
A graphical user interface (GUI) was created to enhance the program's usability, making it more user-friendly. The GUI incorporates several features, such as the ability to save the duration of student attendance, track the number of students in attendance, and generate a file containing the names of the students who attended.
